# DSA Playground

Started: **Jan 29**

This repository documents my DSA preparation journey.
Trying to stay consistent and build strong fundamentals.

---

## Current Focus

- Pattern locking for Two Pointers & Sliding Window
- Linked List structural mastery (reverse, merge, partition, cycle)
- Strengthening approach-building before coding
- Solving targeted LeetCode medium problems (see 2-week execution plan)
- Improving first-10-minute problem analysis

---

## Weekly Progress

### Week 4 (Feb 20 – Feb 27)
- Remove Nth Node From End
- Reverse Linked List II
- Reorder List
- Partition List
- Linked List Cycle II
- Structural reasoning drills (pattern → invariant → exit condition)
- Focus on clean pointer discipline
- Began structured LeetCode 2-week plan (Pattern Locking Phase)

---

### Week 3 (Feb 12 – Feb 19)
